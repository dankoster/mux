This started out as a quick exploration of [server sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events). Then I got super curious about [webRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API). All the connections flying around needed a fun visualization, so let's learn [D3](https://d3js.org/)! Oh, I also wanted to try [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/). And [Deno](https://deno.com/). Then I was having enough fun that I put it on [deno deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) and got a [domain](https://chatmux.com/). 

Not bad for a couple weeks of excited but fairly aimless tinkering.

More to come... I'm having a blast.
